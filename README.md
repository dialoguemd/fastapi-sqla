# fastapi-sqla

SqlAlchemy integration for FastAPIÂ®


## Configuration

The keys of interest in `os.environ` are prefixed with `sqlalchemy_`.
Each matching key (after the prefix is stripped) is treated as though it were the
corresponding keyword argument to [`sqlalchemy.create_engine`]
(https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/core/engines.html?highlight=create_engine#sqlalchemy.create_engine)  # noqa
call.

The only required key is `sqlalchemy_url`, which provides the database URL.
